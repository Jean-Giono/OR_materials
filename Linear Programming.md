## Basics of linear programs

A linear program (LP) is an optimization problem in which the objective function
is linear in the unknowns and the constraints consist of linear equalities and linear
inequalities. The exact form of these constraints may differ from one problem
to another, but as shown below, any linear program can be transformed into the
following standard form:
`minimize c1x1+c2x2+...+cnxn
subject to a11x1+a12x2+...+a1nxn= b1
           a21x1+a22x2+...+a2nxn= b2
           ·                      ·
           ·                      ·       (1)
           ·                      ·
           am1x1+am2x2+···+amnxn= bm
 and       x1>=0, x2>=0,.....,xn>=0`
where the bi’s, ci’s and aij’s are fixed real constants, and the xi’s are real numbers
to be determined. We always assume that each equation has been multiplied by
minus unity, if necessary, so that each bi>=0.
