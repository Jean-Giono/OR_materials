## Optimization

It is important to distingish tractable models from nontractable ones.

We can distingish three classes of problems:
- small-scale problems : having five or fewer unknowns and contraints
- intermediate-scale problems : having about six to a hundred or a thousand variables
- large-scale problems : having perhaps thousands or even millions of variables and constraints

This classification is not entirely rigid, but it reflects at least roughly not only size but the basic differences in approach that accompany different size problems.
As a rough rule, small-scale problems can be solved by hand or by a small computer. Intermediate-scale problems can be solved on a personal computer with general purpose mathematical programming codes.
Large-scale problems require sophisticated codes that exploit special structure and usually require large computers.

The most important characteristic of a high-speed computer is its ability to perform repetitive operations efficiently, and in order to exploit this basic characteristic,
most algorithms designed to solve large optimization problems are iterative in nature.
